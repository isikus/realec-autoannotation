All pieces of news appear due to the work of journalists. Today there are a lot of opinions about the jobs in journalism: is it a good profession to make a living or not?\\nFrom my point of view, journalism is a good profession. First of all, it is a very important kind of job for all people. Due to journalists we get information from all over the world. They make it accessible through the Internet,  TV,  magazines or newspapers, or  radio. They sometimes have to go very far away from their home to make a report from some places where something interesting or even dangerous is happening.  Just imagine how little we would know about what is happening around if there were no journalists. It also should be mentioned that due to rating wars journalists from different media try to never miss a deadline. That is why we also get the latest news in a timely manner. Secondly, journalism is a very interesting profession. Working as a correspondent you often have to go to very unusual places, sometimes even to dangerous areas. Using the skills of getting the required information, you make a good report for people and in addition you learn a lot of new things, see new places, meet people and, what is more important, improve journalistic skills. Journalists should provide the quality material. That is why they have to understand theater, art, politics, which makes their life bright and rich. Furthermore, journalism is a useful profession for the person who works in this sphere. People wanting to become a good journalist in getting their higher education degree learn how to write clear and concise sentences, how to process the required information. Moreover, it is important to be able to deal with different people. So being a journalist you develop personal qualities such as trust, patience, perseverance, tact and tolerance, and communicative skills. All these qualities help people to be successful at work. For example,  author and presenter of the TV program \"Top Secret\" Stanislav Kucher demonstrates \"creative hearing\". Free, quiet manner of conversation, respect, unbiased attitude allow the journalist to discuss even the most sensitive issues without using manipulative techniques.\\nHowever, some people are confident that journalism is a \"dirty\" job because they often make money on other people\\'s mistakes or misfortunes. People suppose that journalist will do almost everything for a scoop or to break a story. I do not agree with this statement. If you are a well educated person you know all libel laws and follow them. Moreover, respectable press companies do everything to maintain their reputation. So they keep an open mind and always check the sources of information before providing a story, and they always respect the privacy of public people. What is  important  there are companies whose work is aimed at monitoring  media.

The company uses two ways of tracking press services. The first one is the audit of the press service for the period of time. The second method is based on feedback from journalists and other media: editors, major bloggers and so on. Skilled, precise, correct survey of journalist\\'s work helps diagnose the problem and prevent its negative effects. Two described methods help determine how precise and objective information of a certain press-service .\\nTo summarize, there are some arguments about the profession of journalist.

Owning to fast pace of life most people spend great amount of their time on transportation. It might be one of the main reasons why some people are concerned with the purposes and usage of transport in future. In my essay I would like to share some of my considerations about the possible and desired changes in this sphere of humans' life. \\nTo begin with I would like to argue that transport in future should be more environmentally friendly. Almost all the cars today are drawing petrol or diesel fuel and produce carbon dioxide and other harmful substances to the atmosphere. Moreover, oil from which petrol and diesel fuel are obtained is a non-renewable recourse and soon it will certainly run out. It's common knowledge that new types of electric vehicle had already been invented, although they are too expensive and as a result not spread enough. \\nAnother big problem today is permanent traffic congestions in every big city. This issue can be solved in many different ways but I'm fancy of suggesting the idea of creating such means of transport that won't require a track to ride. As far as I remember one of the science-fiction writer presenting the idea of creating cars that will move due to the terrestrial magnetic field. It might settle simultaneously the problem of air pollution and traffic jams. \\nAs we are living in the age of information technologies speed of movement has a great significance. I'm convinced that transport in future will be able to transport people as fast as information, for instance e-mails of messages in Skype, now. \\nNobody knows what may happen tomorrow, in two weeks, in couple of years, we can predict, though, and we are vigorous enough to influence on our future and make it better. It refers as well to all spheres of our life and to every person in particular.\\n\",\n",

Lack of this help leads to the stated problem of growing criminality among youngs.\\nThus, parents and teachers as people closest to young generation should take the situation under control. The most obvious idea to do it is to give more attention to children to children and teenagers. Indeed, it is known, that it is common situation, that parents are too busy earning money to get into all details of their child life As for teachers, they often have too much people in class to give proper attention to each individual. But from the other side it is possible for both parents and teachers to cooperate and notice worrying tendentions together. For example, teacher is able to feel changes in whole behavior pattern of his students and give know parents in case something wrong, and then they would take a closer look on changes in their child behaviour.\\nAll in all, it is clear that rising crime committment rate among youngsters is a fact society cannot close eyes on. That is why both parents and teachers should give much attention to younger generation in order to prevent this situation to continue by giving younger people support they need.\\n'},\n",

       "   'unus': 'A story\\nSome years ago I had an old Russian car. It was ten years. As my father sad \"It was never broken down\". That means that the car never broken down before I began to use it. Each day I was founding something new that was not working: lights, accumulator, ignition and generator. Some of that list did not work and was a result of different symptoms. One day I drove on the high-speed road and began to brake. I had a long distance behind. As usually I did it slowly. Suddenly the car stopped because car brakes blocked in spite of the fact I released the brakes. It was terrible. After the car stopped in the middle of the road without any serious need, the brake pedal began to work and it was possible to move. The situation was not very good because the other car owners were not going to stop immediately. I came on the service. The \"master\" said that he knew what the problem is. After his work, nothing has changed. It took me a half of an hour to drive without any immediately stopped and after I applied the brakes the car came to a dead stop. About a week I travel from one service to another trying to find any specialist, who knows what is wrong. And I found the service. My rear brakes did not work: the drop of braking fluid was dropped on the brake shoe. After I broke several times the brake shoe dried out and the brakes blocked. I was happy that everything was ended well.\\n'},\n",

As for Apple, company profits increase from 2010 to 2012, reaching 40, 60 and 70 per cent, respectively with years. Then a little decreasing in 2013, reaching 60 per cent. Finally, increasing again until the end of the period reaching 80 and 90 per cent in 2014 and 2015. Samsung profits increase with different growth rate from 17 in 2010 to its peak over 40 per cent in 2013.
